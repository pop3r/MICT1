Exercise for week 3:

1. Investigate the provided files 'f_z.data' and 'e_r.data'.

2. Extract and organize (part of) the provided data so that they can be interpreted as valid media files.

3. Make a small report describing:

 - What you found
 - Where you found it (locations, spans, etc.)
 - How you found it. What tools? Include source, screenshots, howto's, etc.

Put the report in the /exercises/week3/yourgroupname directory in the repo and
send it in as a Pull Request on Github.

Good luck!
